# Sexy Shrimps Prototype
> Prototype of student education assistant application
> By Callum Breen, Callum Burnet, Luke Coveney and Thomas Salter

## SETUP / Usage
```
The setup of our application is simple it is a WPF application that is coded in visual studio and runs in the students "User Program Files". 
To use our prototype for testing purpose you can use the following:

Usernames:
1014217
1013483
1018752
1019628

Password:
SexyShrimps

The password works for all usernames. 
Our program is able to identify which of these accounts is logged in and display their information including their name, timetable and homework diary entries. 
```

## Questions
1. What functional requirements (those necessary for a basic functional application) still need to be met to make your team's application useful?
```
We have met all functional requirements laid out inside of our Design Document though in a minimalisitic way.
Especially in terms of the diary which we would like to develop further with sorting lists and allowing it to link to the home screen.
As a whole we would like our program to run off of a database for our final submission that would allow usage across computers and a more secure way of running it.
```

2. Has your team deviated from your original design? If so, why?
```
We have deviated from our original UI design as it was not very clean or professional looking.
We have created a new christ church theme instead of the dark theme we were originally planning on going with.
We have not changed the purpose or functionality of our program.
```

3. Which of the functional requirements have you personally implemented so far?
```
Salter - Login, Mainscreen, Timetable, Diary, Map, Many bug fixes, Github Manager, Design Manager, Project Lead.
Breen - Diary and Time
Burnet - Map, Sport Fixtures
Coveney - Assisted UI Design, Bug fixes,Sport Fixtures
```

4. Which new features are you working on at the moment?
```
Currently we are working on our first "Should have" which is the sport fixtures.
We are about to further develop the map to be interactive instead of just a picture, this is also a should have.
The diary is also about to see some changes, mainly linking to the main screen.
The big change will be implementing a database into our design.
```

5. Are there any major bugs or complications slowing you down?
```
We have luckily ironed out any bugs or issues slowing us down.
Our method of collaboration and research has made it possible for us to adapt code easily for our purpose.
Due to this our prototype is better and even further than we wanted.

OLD README:

Created a readme, yay!

Added some more stuff

Hey I just had a great idea, here goes.

PogU PogU

Starting Bid for CALLUM AND CALLUM: 14 Coding Hours

we need to sell them ASAD
please buy them


SHUSH MR NOLAN!!!!!!


please buy them

PogU PogU

no callums please
get-rid-of-CB's


Ignore Mr Nolan

Mr Nolan's Code:

I think we should keep both Callums
GitHub Desktop seems pretty cool yo
The command line is also good but has a steep learning curve and can be difficult to visualise what's going on.
WE NEED TO GET 100 COMMITS WITHOUT EVEN CODING, JUST THE READ ME
